# puppy_love

This was completed during my time at Rockit Bootcamp in the summer of 2015 and hasn't been updated with root variables or the latest css naming conventions.

This is a static page site. It was created as a project to see how closely I could match an exsiting markup design, and show off my skills in CSS and HTML, particularly with the naming conventions for modular and responsive CSS.
