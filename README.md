# puppy_love

This is purely a Static page. It was created as a project to see how closely I could match an exsiting image, and show off my skills in CSS and HTML. Particularly with the naming conventions for modular CSS. (This was completed during Rockit Bootcamp 2015 and hasn't been updated with root variables or the latest css naming conventions)
