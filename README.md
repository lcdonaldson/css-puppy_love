# puppy_love

This is purely a Static CSS page. It was created as a project to see how closely I could match an exsiting picture of the same site, and show off my skills in CSS and HTML. Particularly with the naming conventions for modular CSS. (This was completed during Rockit Bootcamp and hasn't been updated with root variables or the latest css naming conventions)
